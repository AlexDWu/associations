There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Associations


## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  This product is for anyone who wants to quickly discover new media or content according to their personal tastes.


## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Associations is an application that allows you to choose a variety of topics you are interested in or passionate about.
  You can then add items related to that topic that you are especially interested in. For example, foodies would add 
  Ramen Dojo to their "Food" topic. Our application would then look up users also interested in Ramen Dojo to see if they
  like any other type of food that hasn't been added to your profile yet. Associations will then recommend that you try 
  this new type of food. Associations aims to enrich your life by helping you make new discoveries more quickly. 


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Discovering new quality content on the Internet normally takes hours of nearly aimless browsing. Associations uses
  user data to help other users enrich their lives faster and more easily. 


## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Associations analyzes what each user's personal tastes are. The application measures how compatible users' tastes are
  to obtain an association index. This index is used to decide what new content Associations recommends to its users.


## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "The ocean of new content is constantly getting deeper -- let Associations do the fishing for you."


## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  All users need to do is create a profile, select topics they're interested in, and add specific items they think are
  especially enjoyable.


## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "For me, finding a good song entailed listening to hours of mediocre tunes first. Associations cut that time down
  to a mere few minutes!"


## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  There are so many amazing things to discover and so little time to spend arduously searching for them. Associations
  can help you enrich your life as soon as possible. In the meantime, anyone hungry for new content should look into
  Google search techniques for more efficient Web browsing.
